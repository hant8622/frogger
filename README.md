# Frogger
Implementation of the classic arcade game Frogger and inspired by Tim Dwyer's Asteroids in FRP: https://tgdwyer.github.io/asteroids/

## Gameplay Instructions
Play the classical arcade game, where you control a frog and help it cross from the bottom of the canvas to the top.

Use the W, A, S and D key to control the frog in its respective direction and press the ENTER key to restart. Your aim is to guide the frog to each of the 5 target slots on top of the screen without losing. You will be face with obstacles, such as cars that will collide with the frog, causing a game over. Other ways to lose is directly entering the river, hitting the boundaries while on a water object (turtles or logs), or hitting the bushes beside each target slots.

The player will receive points upon reaching each target area and continue to beat your previous record! Don't give up and remember to have fun as much as possible.
